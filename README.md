# Rule-based-chatbot
In this notebook, a rule based chatbot is created. Python programming language is used for this purpose and NLTK library is imported. The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).


The conversation between the user and the chatbot is limited to the pairs and reflections which are already predefined by the user in the program. This implementation of chatbot is very simple and just to showcase the application of machine learning.
